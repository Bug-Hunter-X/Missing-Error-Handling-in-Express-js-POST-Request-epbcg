# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for POST requests.  When an application receives a POST request with missing or malformed data, it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes without proper error handling.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The bug lies in the `/users` POST route.  It lacks validation and error handling for the incoming request body. If a client sends a request with missing or invalid data (e.g., a missing `user` object), the application may crash or behave unpredictably.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and comprehensive error handling.  This ensures that the application gracefully handles invalid data, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
